### Preprocessing

MorphAGram uses the Pitman-Yor Adaptor-Grammar Sampler (PYAGS), developed by Mark Johnson, for training. The sampler can be downloaded from [here](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/code/py-cfg-2013-09-23.tgz "here").

For complete information about how the sampler works, see [paper](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/adaptornips.pdf "paper").

The sampler requires two types of inputs: a grammar and a list of training units. For the purpose of morphological segmentation, a grammar should specify word structure, while the list of training units is a list of words (a lexicon). On the other hand, MorphAGram requires the text to be in the Hex format in order to meet the language-independence assumption and to escape special characters. Also the grammar should have the characters that form the input words as terminals.

The first step is to provide an initial CFG (Context-Free grammar) and a list of words (one word per line) to MorphAGram, which in turn converts them into inputs to PYAGS. The initial CFG should have two parameters associated with each production rule (default values are zeros). The first number represents the value of the probability of the rule in the generator, and the second number is the value of the Î± parameter in the Pitman-Yor process. Below is an example CFG.

*1 1 Word --> Prefix Stem Suffix<br/>
Prefix --> ^^^<br/>
Prefix --> ^^^ PrefixMorphs<br/>
1 1 PrefixMorphs --> PrefixMorph PrefixMorphs<br/>
1 1 PrefixMorphs --> PrefixMorph<br/>
PrefixMorph --> SubMorphs<br/>
Stem --> SubMorphs<br/>
Suffix --> $$$<br/>
Suffix --> SuffixMorphs $$$<br/>
1 1 SuffixMorphs --> SuffixMorph SuffixMorphs<br/>
1 1 SuffixMorphs --> SuffixMorph<br/>
SuffixMorph --> SubMorphs<br/>
1 1 SubMorphs --> SubMorph SubMorphs<br/>
1 1 SubMorphs --> SubMorph<br/>
SubMorph --> Chars<br/>
1 1 Chars --> Char<br/>
1 1 Chars --> Char Chars*

MorphAGram has three learning settings; Standard, Scholar-Seeded and Cascaded.  Here is how to preprocess the data for each setting:

#### a) Standard Setting
The Standard setting is a language-independent one, with no scholar knowledge and with only one learning phase.

##### Steps:
\# Read the initial lexicon (word list), and convert it into Hex.<br/>
`words, encoded_words, hex_chars = process_words(lexicon_path)`<br/>
`write_encoded_words(encoded_words, encoded_lexicon_path)`<br/>
\# Read the initial CFG and append the HEX encoded characters as terminals.<br/>
\# encoded_lexicon_path and final_grammar_path then become the input to the PYAGS sampler.<br/>
`grammar = read_grammar(grammar_path)`<br/>
`appended_grammar = add_chars_to_grammar(grammar, hex_chars)`<br/>
`write_grammar(appended_grammar, final_grammar_path)`<br/>


#### b) Scholar-Seeded Setting
The Scholar-Seeded setting seeds scholar information in the form of prefixes and suffixes into the grammar tree prior to running the learning phase. The setting first requires the preparation of an LK file (LK=Linguistic Knowledge). An example LK file is shown below, where it may contain any number of prefixes and suffixes.

*###PREFIXES###*<br/>
*prefix1*<br/>
*prefix2*<br/>
*prefix3*<br/>
*###SUFFIXES###*<br/>
*prefix1*<br/>
*prefix2*<br/>
*prefix3*

##### Steps:
\# Read the initial lexicon (word list), and convert it into Hex.<br/>
`words, encoded_words, hex_chars = process_words(lexicon_path)`<br/>
`write_encoded_words(encoded_words, encoded_lexicon_path)`<br/>
\# Read the initial CFG.<br/>
`grammar = read_grammar(grammar_path)`<br/>
\# Seed affixes into the grammar, where the affixes are read from the LK file.<br/>
`ss_grammar = prepare_scholar_seeded_grammar(grammar, linguistic_knowledge_path, prefix_nonterminal_to_seed_into, suffix_nonterminal_to_seed_into, concentration_param_alphaa, concentration_param_alphab)`<br/>
`write_grammar(ss_grammar, ss_grammar_path)`<br/>
\# Append the Hex encoded characters as terminals.<br/>
\# encoded_lexicon_path and final_grammar_path then become the input to the PYAGS sampler.<br/>
`appended_ss_grammar = add_chars_to_grammar(ss_grammar, hex_chars)`<br/>
`write_grammar(appended_ss_grammar, final_grammar_path)`<br/>

#### c) Cascaded Setting
The cascaded setting approximates the effect of the Scholar-Seeded setting in a language-independent manner, where the seeded affixes are automatically  generated in one learning phase and then seeded into the grammar tree in a second round of learning.

##### Steps:
\# Read the initial lexicon (word list), and convert it into Hex.<br/>
`words, encoded_words, hex_chars = process_words(lexicon_path)`<br/>
`write_encoded_words(encoded_words, encoded_lexicon_path)`<br/>
\# Read the initial CFG.<br/>
`grammar = read_grammar(grammar_path)`<br/>
\# Read the automatically generated affixes from the segmentation output of a prior learning phase.<br/>
`cascaded_grammar = prepare_cascaded_grammar(grammar, segmentation_output_path, number_of_affixes_to_read, prefix_nonterminal_to_read, suffix_nonterminal_to_read, prefix_nonterminal_to_seed_into, suffix_nonterminal_to_seed_into, concentration_param_alphaa, concentration_param_alphab)`<br/>
`write_grammar(cascaded_grammar, cascaded_grammar_path)`<br/>
\# Append the Hex encoded characters as terminals.<br/>
\# encoded_lexicon_path and final_grammar_path then become the input to the PYAGS sampler.<br/>
`appended_cascaded_grammar = add_chars_to_grammar(cascaded_grammar, hex_chars)`<br/>
`write_grammar(appended_cascaded_grammar, final_grammar_path)`<br/>

### Training

Download and run the Pitman-Yor Adaptor-Grammar Sampler (PYAGS), developed by Mark Johnson, where the input to the sampler is the output of the preprocessing phase. The sampler can be downloaded from [here](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/code/py-cfg-2013-09-23.tgz "here").

In order to replicate our results in [MorphAGram, Evaluation and Framework for Unsupervised Morphological Segmentation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.879.pdf "MorphAGram, Evaluation and Framework for Unsupervised Morphological Segmentation"), please use the following parameters:
`-r 0 -d 10 -x 10 -D -E -e 1 -f 1 -g 10 -h 0.1 -w 1 -T 1 -m 0 -n 500 -R`

For complete information about how the sampler works, see [paper](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/adaptornips.pdf "paper").

### Segmentation

#### Method1:
\# If a word is seen in the training data, its segmentation is read from the segmentation output of the learning process.<br/>
\# If a word is not seen in the training data, it's analyzed by finding the split that gives the highest MLE probability across its morphemes, along with the selection of compatible prefixes and suffixes. The information of the morphemes and their MLE probabilities and compatibility are driven from the segmentation output of the learning process.
\# This method is applicable only when the prefixes, stems and suffixes are represented by three different nonterminals.

##### Steps:
\# Create a segmentation model given the PYAGS segmentation output.<br/>
\# The step requires specifying which nonterminals to split on.<br/>
\# In addition to generating the segmentation model, the step generates a human-readable segmentation output that can be directly used as the prediction input for the evaluation scripts used in the Morpho-Challenge shared task.<br/>
\# The <language> parameter is optional. If used, it should be the ISO-639-1 language code, and it only affects Turkish (for its special lowercasing and uppercasing).<br/>
`segmentation_model = parse_segmentation_output(segmentation_output_path, prefix_nonterminal, stem_nonterminal, suffix_nonterminal, segmentation_eval_output_path , language, min_word_length_to_segment)`<br/>
\# Segment a white-space tokenized text string.<br/>
\# When both <split_marker> and <stem_marker> parameters are set to None, the function does only stemming.<br/>
`segmented_text = segment_text(text_to_segment, segmentation_model, morph_separator, stem_marker, do_not_segment_nonfirst_capitalized_words, language , min_word_length_to_segment)`<br/>
\# Segment a white-space tokenized text file.<br/>
\# When both <split_marker> and <stem_marker> parameters are set to None, the function does only stemming.<br/>
`segment_file(file_to_segment, output_path, segmentation_model, morph_separator, stem_marker, do_not_segment_nonfirst_capitalized_words, language , min_word_length_to_segment)`<br/>

#### Method2:
\# Do regular grammar parsing.<br/>

##### Steps:
\# Normalize the output grammar.<br/>
`grammar = generate_grammar(pyags_output_grammar_path)`<br/>
`write_grammar(grammar, final_grammar_path)`<br/>
\# Apply some off-the-shelf CKY parser.

### Automatic Tailoring of Grammars

#### 1. Standard vs. Cascaded

For a language with no segmentation data available, we recommend running the best on-average performing grammar (PrStSu+SM|index=1 in the data directory). For the selection between the Standard and Cascaded settings, use the `standard_cascaded_classification.py` script as follows:
`python standard_cascaded_classification.py ap_sc.model segmentation_output_path prefix_nonterminal suffix_nonterminal`
where <segmentation_output_path> is recommended to be based on a quick sampling process of 50 iterations using the PrStSu+SM grammar. 

#### 2. Scholar_Seeded

For the selection of the best Scholar-Seeded grammar, choose the one that produces the largest number of affixes in common with those provided as linguistic knowledge. In order to get the number of matches, use the `scholar_seeded_matcher.py` script as follows:
`python scholar_seeded_matcher.py linguistic_knowledge_path egmentation_output_path prefix_nonterminal suffix_nonterminal`

### Analysis

#### 1. Language analysis
\# The analysis is based on gold data, where gold_path is a tabular file; the first column contains the words, and the second column contains comma-separated segmentations as space-separated morphs.<br/>
\# The analysis is assumed to be applicable to the corresponding language as long as the gold is a well representative sample.<br/>
\# gold_info: a map that contains analysis information for the gold. This includes:<br/>
word-morph mapping, number of morphs, unweighted/weighted degree of ambiguity, average token/type morph length, average number of morphs per word and the maximum number of morphs in a word.<br/>
\# morh_info: a map that contains analysis information for each morh. This includes:<br/>
morph count, morph frequency and morph probability (the probability that a sequence of characters forms the corresponding morph).<br/>
`gold_info, morph_info = analyze_gold(gold_path)`<br/>

#### 2. Segmentation-Output Analysis
\# output_path and gold_path are tabular files; the first column contains the words, and the second column contains the segmentation as space-separated morphs. In the case of gold_path, multiple comma-separated segmentations can be listed.<br/>
\# morh_info: a map that contains analysis information for each morph. This includes:<br/>
morph count, morph frequency, morph probability (the probability that a sequence of characters forms the corresponding morph), morph precision, morph recall and morph F1-score.<br/>
`morph_info = analyze_gold(output_path, gold_path)`<br/>

#### 3. Feature Extraction
\# Given a PYAGS segmentation output, this function extracts affix-related information that could then be used as ML features as pointed out [here](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5808.pdf "here").<br/>
\# For each simple prefix, complex prefix, simple suffix and complex suffix, the information includes: type count, average count per word and average length.<br/>
\# The function is only applicable when the prefixes and suffixes are represented by different nonterminals.<br/>
`affix_info = get_affix_features(segmentation_output_path, prefix_nonterminal, suffix_nonterminal, min_appearance_of_affix_to_consider)`<br/>
